# Chef's Corner

Chef's Corner is a recipe management system created by our four person Agile Development team as part of our semester long capstone class.

## Software

This was created with the .Net framework in Visual Studio 2017. We utilized several languages and tools for this:

* C#
* SQL Server
* Razor
* Javascript
* JSON
* Web API through Spoonacular
* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap

## Showcases

* Perform several searches through our api service:
     1) Ingredient substitution search
     2) Search for a recipe based on an ingredient
     1) Pull up an image based on an ingredient search
* Print recipes
* Save recipes to a personal profile that is authenticated through SQL Server
* Perform CRUD operations on your saved recipes
* Upload your own personal recipe to save to your profile alongside saved recipes
* Share recipes via social media 

#### This project is the work of Logan Jones alongside three other team members who created this for a semester long project in our capstone Agile Development course at FVTC.
